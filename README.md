# Tic-Tac-Toe

### This project was originally created using vanilla javascript but as the class and course went ont, we learned jQuery, which makes my life so much easier. I later decided that I want to make this using jQuery to practice more jQuery. So the repo name might be misleading. But do take note that it was originally created using vanilla js.
